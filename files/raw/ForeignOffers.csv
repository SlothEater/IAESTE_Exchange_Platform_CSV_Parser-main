Experience with app development and AI engineering will definitely help out in the selection.
If student does not have EEA or Swiss nationality, stay is limited to 90 days due to work permit regulations.","Stampix is a free photo printing service, where business is run by partnering with brands that want to reach out to (potential) customers on the backside of these photos.
As of late, we have been investing our resources into finding out how we can reduce the effort needed by users to select their photos. For this, we have developed an AI that runs entirely on the user's smartphone and analyzes photos on the camera roll. The best photos get automatically suggested to the user for their next set of free prints.
The internship project is twofold and consists of an on-edge optimization and implementing a recommendation system.

1) Optimization
As previously mentioned, the Stampix app has an on-device AI that selects the best photos from the camera roll from a user. For this, several steps are taken to introduce a ranking in the photos, where rank 1 indicates the “most printable” photo.
Currently, a functional prototype of this has been worked out in cross-platform code. This is currently causing a slow processing time per photo. The goal of this project is to largely decrease this time. A robust architecturing exercise is needed to bring this prototype to a state of excellence. For this, actual algorithmic logic is best implemented in native code, as to get rid of channel communication delays and use the full processing power of the CPU, GPU & NPU instead. The Stampix app is written in cross-platform React Native code, so an abstraction layer should always be present.

2) Recommendation System
Our current AI is a general concept that is applied to our entire user base. It does not take into account personal preferences for users (e.g. strong preference for selfies, cats, specific person, etc..).
This part of the internship consists of architecturing and developing a personal recommendation engine that is able to learn (over time) what the user prefers. The features & feedback points for a content-based recommendation is available through the means of the ordering flow. Everytime a user swaps a photo from our suggestion, we have both a new negative & new positive example of what the user likes and dislikes.
This recommendation system should work side-by-side with the on-device AI. This means that previous swapped-out photos should not be re-recommended to the user and that important features should be put forward in the ranking.
Photos are a sensitive subject in a lot of circumstances, so the algorithm should take into account sudden changes of user preferences. For example, a user might print a lot of photos from a new kitten, but might suddenly very much dislike seeing these photos after it passed away. If a user removes all photos concerning a certain topic from our suggestion, the algorithm should very negatively score this topic in future passes of the algorithm.
Lastly, a user-preference vector should be synced with the back end infrastructure in order to provide a consistent experience across devices, sign outs, app updates, etc.",6,16,2022-06-01,2022-09-30,Yes,Yes,No,,English,"Excellent (C1, C2)",,,,,,,EUR,1000,Monthly,0,Trainee with the help of IAESTE LC Ghent,500,Monthly,1000,Monthly,,"11-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES, 14A-ENGINEERING, Other",,,,,,,2022-01-22 08:41:23,2022-01-22 08:41:23,3,"The intern should be able to work in a supervised but structured, independent way.

Operating particle accelerator facilities and nuclear installations can produce radioactive materials. Regulatory control requests that releases of materials to the environment are in compliance with legal limits. As a result, each of these locations is constantly surveyed by radiation detection instruments using scintillation or solid-state detectors. These detectors need to be reliably characterized. The section Expertise and Analytics of the PSI Department of Radiation Safety and Security seeks a student that supports within the process of characterizing these survey instruments at PSI.

Your Tasks:
The first step for the characterization of the available scintillation or solid-state detectors is the evaluation of the instruments energy dependent response for photon radiation and can be carried out by using Monte Carlo methods or measurements of well known radioactive sources. The student’s task will be to evaluate a suitable approach and to perform the necessary measurements or calculations. The evaluation of the acquired data is also included in the project.

Knockoffs are features that are generated to ""look like"" the actual features but are conditionally independent of the label given by the actual features. The knockoff framework for feature selection is a recent breakthrough in statistics, which theoretically allows the identification of truly correlated features while ensuring that the false discovery rate is controlled. Fixed-X Knockoff and Model-X Knockoff feature selections provide good real-world results only if the conditional distribution of the response or the joint distribution of the original features are Gaussian. We would like to generate knockoff features that capture the joint distribution of all original features so that the original and knockoff counterparts are as decorrelated as possible. One idea is to use the copula method, which is a powerful tool for modeling the dependence structure; but in addition, we need to find a challenging idea to generate the marginal distributions such that, combined with the copulas, we get the knockoff features.

The quality of the emerging interaction in terms of efficiency, overall experience and well-being will then be shaped by the “personality” of this room intelligence.

The instrumented lab features two collaborative robotic arms which will assist the user in everyday tasks, like cooking, cleaning or serving food. For the purpose of interacting with objects inside the lab,  suitable combinations of robotic grippers and storage containers have to be found and motion routines have to be carefully created and evaluated. This includes among other tasks:

* preliminary research of available and compatible robotic grippers
* designing and prototyping of suitable containers for the robot to interact with
* procurement of necessary products and materials
* programming and “teaching” of motion routines to the robot
* combining motion routines with integrated “grasping AI”
* testing these routines for safety, flexibility and reliability

Solid programming and organizational skills are required. Interns will have the opportunity to work with state of the art technology and prototyping machinery.
